Bmw x7 is my favourite car and i just buy this monster and i plan to trip with this car in Ladakh so i am very excited yeahh!! This car is really nice in this segment : you can buy this.
Pros are as follows  !!!
Comfortable and spacious .
Stylish design .
Punchy performance. 
Cons  are as Follows  !!!
A bit expensive .
A good car has good image in society.
Pricing is too much comparatively. It could have been around 90 lakhs.  Given with the specifications and other makes, it looks clearly pricing is at the higher range.  If the price is slashed many will be buying at a faster rate.
The car has developed 12 part failures in one year of operation. The company management including the CEO is taking things lightly.  No voice for indian customers.  We are just taken for a ride.
Its is a massive SUV with ultra luxury features and premium looks. 500 km drive shouldnt be an issue on this car. Mileage is bit low but for individual who is buying this shouldn't be an issue. It has all the premium features available.
Everyone who are about to read it I am informing you in advance that it is pretty long.
I and my family were in the market for a high-end luxury SUV with a seating capacity of 6 people. We first thought of buying 2 Rolls-Royce Cullinan's dark badge editions and 2 Aston Martin DBX. But we checked in carwale if there was an Aston Martin showroom here in Hyderabad, it said that I needed to go to New-Delhi or Mumbai for the Aston Martin DBX. So I checked with Kun Exclusive Rolls-Royce to give me 2 Rolls-Royce Cullinanan's in 1 or 2 months and asked them if there is a service center in Hyderabad. So they told me that there is a service center in Hyderabad but they can not give me 2 Rolls-Royce Cullinan's in 1 or 2 months, they said it will at least take them 6 months to get the Rolls-Royce Cullinan's. So I called up Bmw Kun Exclusive Hyderabad and asked them if they can give 2 BMW x7's in 1 or two months, They said they can give me 2 of them in 1-month max Since I already have a 2011 BMW 330i, 2010 BMW 520D, I knew that there was a service center. So I went ahead and paid BMW Kun exclusive the booking amount for 2 black x7's and paid the final amount.
Now coming to the driving experience
I had bought the BMW x7's in march 2019. Till now I had driven it for about 2 lakh km in almost 2 years.  I am doing a long trip to London with my family in the 2 x7's in about a week or so,  I had just got my travel permission for going to London in my car.
Here are the top 10 reasons to buy Bmw x7
Quick Acceleration
3 strong engines 
touchscreen
advanced technology
many storage opportunities
luxury seats
Everyone who is about to read my review I am informing you in advance that it will be pretty long. I and my family were in the market for a high-end luxury SUV. We first thought of buying 1 Rolls-Royce Cullinan Dark Badge's or 1 BMW X7'S or Aston Martin DBX, so we checked with Rolls-Royce India if there is a Rolls-Royce showroom and service in Hyderabad, they said they had both of them in Hyderabad which is owned by KUN-Exclusive which is above the BMW showroom and next to Mini-Cooper Showroom, next we contacted Rolls-Royce Hyderabad and asked if they had 1 Cullinan Dark Badge in stock, So the other one may take about 6 months for it to come to Hyderabad, so we said we do not need them. Next, we called Aston-Martin India and asked if there is a showroom and Service-Centre in Hyderabad, they said the nearest showroom and service Centre is 12 hours away from Hyderabad and 13 hours 2 minutes from my house, Next let us go to BMW X7, I already know that there is a showroom and a  Service-Centre in Hyderabad, As I already own 3 BMW'S which is a 2011 BMW 330I, 2010 BMW  520D, and a BMW 2021 X7 40I M-SPORT. As I mentioned in the BMW X740I M-sport review that We were planning to buy 2 high-end luxury SUV's we bought a BMW X740I M-sport, but since they did not have 2 of the X7 40I M-sport we purchased one BMW X7 Dark Shadow Edition.
THE SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE
The maintenance is easy for you guys because it is very easy because even if you crash only a dent will come on the body, only if you do a crash when you are at full speed then only the car will get major damages, even if you are in the car not wearing a seatbelt also then also you will not get hurt because the airbags will be deployed when you are met with the accident, and also will immediately call the roadside assistance, they will come for your emergency immediately.

DRIVING EXPERIENCE 

Till now I had driven it for about 2 lakh km in almost 2 years.  I am doing a long trip to London with my family in the Bmw x7 in about a week or so,  I had just got my travel permission for going to London in my car.

NOW COMING TO PROS AND CONS

The pros of the dark shadow edition are the light M-sport 22-inch alloys in a V-Spoke design with a matt-black finish and fitted with mixed tires. The superior engine is accompanied by the emotionally powerful sound of the M-Sport Exhaust System.

This car is phenomenal for starters.  I have black X7 M50D which cost me around 2.15 cr on road Bangalore.
Things I extremely like about this car are :  
1. Engine is like ready to race, so much of grunt, tons of power and torque is like amazing if you are fully loaded with 7 people then also no worries it pulls and pulls and pulls.
2. Comfort is like you can easily compete with the Mercedes GLS,
3. Features are like abounded in this car
4. Great thing is that being a flagship SUV of BMW, maintenance cost is on the lesser side.
For me there are  no CONS about this car
I am having a wonderful time with my X7 in lockdown.  
1 thing I would like to include about is the fuel economy. Now considering its engine and performance the mileage is very good, it returns the mileage of 11kmpl on highway and 7.5 to 8.3 in city.
The car is so good 
Every rupee is worth 
The car is so smooth but not that good for off-roading 
The new Grille is so good 
Service is promising 
The seating comfort is the best  
The best car of recent times
This car very attractive and royal looks. My dreams car this only. After 3 years back I will purchase this car confirm and it's my strong goal. BMW car purchase and driving &living
BMW has launched the X7 in India. It is positioned above the X5 in the company's SUV model line-up and is available in two variants - xDrive40i and xDrive30d Design Pure Excellence Signature, both priced at Rs. 98.90 lakh (ex-showroom, India). The petrol version will be imported as a completely built unit (CBU), while the diesel version will be assembled locally.   
The BMW X7 measures 5,151 mm in length, 2,000 mm in width and 1,805 mm in height with a wheelbase of 3,105 mm. Its luggage capacity ranges from 326 to 2,120 litres. 
The X7 features a large twin-kidney grille finished in chrome and has slim twin-pod LED headlamps on either side. The front bumper has chrome inserts and houses a dual-slat air dam with vents on either side and a silver skid plate. It has wraparound tail lights and twin chrome exhaust tips. 
On the inside, the new X7 gets a dual-tone dashboard with a 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and gesture control, 4-zone automatic climate control, wireless charging, ambient lighting and a panoramic sunroof. It has a 3-spoke multi-function steering wheel and a digital instrument cluster. The diesel variant gets a 5-zone climate control system and BMW Laserlight headlamps.  
The X7 is available in 6 or 7-seater configurations. All three rows of seats get reclining function. Rear seat passengers get 10.2-inch screens as part of the Rear-seat Entertainment Professional package. 
The X7 xDrive40i is powered by a 3.0-litre, 6-cylinder, turbocharged petrol engine that produces 335 BHP and 450 Nm @ 1,500-5,200 rpm, while the xDrive30d comes with a 3.0-litre, 6-cylinder diesel engine that makes 261 BHP @ 4,000 rpm and 620 Nm @ 1,500-2,500 rpm. Both engines are mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission and an all-wheel drive system. The SUV is equipped with air-suspension that can be raised or lowered. 
Safety features offered in the X7 include 6 airbags, Attentiveness Assistance, Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) including Cornering Brake Control (CBC), electronically controlled ‘Automatic Differential Brakes/Locks’ (ADB-X), traction control, Hill Start Assist and Hill Descent Control, 360-degree camera and Reversing Assistant among others.

They have clearly shadowed out the 'Exciting, modern and ever growing Kidney'.  
Btw, was this the one which had mood lighting for the Kidney? 
Finally a good competitor for the aging GLS (new one coming up in an year) and the superb XC90 from the stable of BMW. Good to have another option in the SUV segment for true 7 seater and not the ersatz 7 seaters that we have in the market today. 
Hope they have some good discounts coming up at the end of the year 
That kidney grill though  , hope they town it down with the mid year refresh.
One of the last chances to acquire the famed BMW in-line 6 petrol engine! It is a dying breed - even the 5-series available in India has switched to an i4 on the 530i - even though that is a superb turbocharged 4 cylinder that outperforms the NA i6s of the last generation in every way.
This thing is so big that an entire Maruti 800 could fit within the wheelbase and the width! It is probably as big as an LCV like a 407! 
How does one find space on today's crowded roads to drive one? Does it need a "cleaner" to help guide the driver in traffic? Wow! Wow!
What's wrong with BMW India's pricing strategy ?  
The X7 in the USA starts at aprox U$ 74k & in India it is priced @ 98.90L. 
Where as the M4 in the USA starts at aprox U$ 69k & in India it was launched @ 1.3x cr.  
Hope no one here starts discussing about how the cars are specced in india v/s USA etc. & all such small talk in support of BMW India. 
Both are CBU's (atleast one of the X7 variant is & also the M3/4 are imports). Whatever happened lets hope the next gen M3/4 is priced similarly to the x7 pricing.

What pricing were you expecting Karan? I'm surprised it's not above 1 cr . Considering the fact that India is moving towards electric and no sops given for ICE sales which are lagging since last few months I think buying a ICE car is going to keep increasing. The government is going to keep increasing taxes on ICE cars and petrol diesel products and indirectly force consumers to shift to electric. Trust me that's what they've thought of and are implementing.

Im happy with the x7 pricing, just irritated with the fact that a cheaper car is priced almost 30% more in India.

Definitely agree with you there. I sat in the x7 and even drove it a little bit almost 2-3 months back in Mumbai. It's a huge car. Feels so large I felt I was driving a large truck which was beautifully done on the inside. Dont know how the drivers are going to acclimatise themselves to the dimensions. 
I wish the cars were cheaper like abroad in India and we could buy better quality cars for a change.
This pricing and the Six Seat option make it ultra tempting. Initially I read about pricing in the region on 1.3 to 1.5 cr ex showroom. So it was never in contention. But at 20% premium over X5 on road it should enter the fray 
I sent the brochure to my dad. I should check out the Car as soon as it is available.

Rest assured this will find immense love in 2 places, one being Mumbai. The sole movie-star arriving to a party or event entering a narrow, broken cobblestone road in a BMW lorry will get him/her maximum coverage and flashbulbs, after all. This might just be the one to topple the current bolly favorite Audi Q7, heck this looks like it'll eat a Q7 for breakfast, but fear not, the Q8/Q9 might well be on the way. 
The second will be Punjab/NCR.. this will look a bit less ridiculous there since the roads aren't as crowded and we all know their love affair with the vaddi gaddi. People who pull up to a highway-side dhaba in that will have the patrons dropping their lassi glass staring at that behemoth. 
Big and SUV seems to be the way to go globally, but in India I'm shivering to see how the future X9/11/13 will look like, the grill might be human sized on its own.

Both are CBU's (atleast one of the X7 variant is & also the M3/4 are imports). Whatever happened lets hope the next gen M3/4 is priced similarly to the x7 pricing.      I can imagine your predicament. So, how they usually work is by committing some numbers on CBU models to HQ and a road map for converting CBU to CKD, in such cases they get support &  keep the CIF value limited under 40-K USD, Petrol engines with less than 3000 ccs qualify for lower Custom. Such vehicles do lose some features also as in this case of X7. 
On M4 or M3 this is not possible as there are no firm buyers and CKD is ruled out. They did the same on M2 and recently with Z4, but I don't think M4 and M5 can get them any significant numbers even of they drop prices by 20-30%.   Quote:

Yes, It's indeed competitive. Except for the ventilated seats, this ticks almost everything else. Really hard to find anything wrong and yes this thing is huge. Larger than anything else and still drives like a BMW. Rear captain seats will be very useful for the chauffer driven vehicles and this will be one of the most comfortable Cars for the rear passengers.

For the price that it has been launched it will sell well. Heck Im sure there have been quite a number of pre-orders already. At least 3 of my friends are getting one. 
As far as Bollywood is concerned, yes it will find quite a few takers. But the Q7 has long been toppled as the Bolly favourite. That place has now been taken by the Range Rover LWB. In fact I see more LWB Range Rovers than the standard Vogue or Sport on the road, Bollywood or otherwise.
Is it just me or is that grill looking out of place? Would have liked the classic grill better. This is looking outlandish.
