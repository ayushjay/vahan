Awesome driving experience. Power combined with ultimate luxury. Majestic. We have driven from Delhi to Binsar and from Delhi to Ranthambhore. Very comfortable and spacious. Wish BMW could have added ventilated seats & blind spot side mirrors. Hope Android play is added soon with software update. Over all a great SUV.
I love mostly the cars, so I always review the car details in this carwale site, current models & upcoming models, so really it was a good site, to know all specifications 
& full detail & updates easily.
I bought this car 2 months back and boy I have not regretted a single time since then of my purchase. As always BMW cars have always been my fav and this X5 has set my expectations even higher. Comparing it to its german rivals Mercedes is lying in foothills and Audi is not even in the game. Wherever you go it creates a presence that you have arrived.  You want to go sporty then the X5 fulfils your need, you want luxury it fulfils your need.  I have driven it 600 kilometres and every time I get in the car it brings a smile on my face. Value for money.

It's really a BEAST.

Hello every one x5 is a very amazing daily driven suv . I have x5 from last 3 years and the car hasn’t let me down till date . I would recommend everyone to at least to go for test drive of this car .
I drove this SUV on a recent holiday in the mountains where I drove it for around 650kms of winding roads. The car was almost brand new with only 2000-something km on it. 
As far as SUVs go, I am sure better ones exist but I haven't driven anything as good as this car, not even the 5-series. When it comes to control on tight curves on roads through the mountains, this car is extraordinary. It felt as easy to drive as a 1-series petrol - and the 1-series petrol is a fun car indeed. This car looks a lot like the old X5 but it's a completely different beast to drive. This is also a very smart car - it will remember all of your driver settings - the onboard navigation is perfect, the user interface is the best, it understands your gestures for volume control and many other functions, it will keep you in the lane, and it will even park itself. The head-up display is a life-saver. The sensors and  cameras give a 360 degree view of the car's surroundings, making parking and reversing a breeze. To illustrate the case, I was on a single road in the mountains. The road was  just wide enough for the X5 and I had to reverse almost 100m to a passing point to accomodate a car coming from the opposite side. Any other unfamiliar car and I would have sweated a bit but with this car, there was a sense of complete control - just look at the display and reverse. I consider a car to have a good pick-up if I am scared to floor the acclerator and this one meets that criterion. It's quick, really quick. You can overtake any car within three seconds - take the usual precautions though. And if you intend to drive like that frequently, believe in yourself and turn off the lane assist.  
The fuel economy was around 11-12 kmpl, which was OK but I expect that number to be significantly better if driven on flat roads without frequent braking and accleration. The roads I drove on were among the best in the world. I can't mention the top speed that I drove this car at but what I can say is this - the only thing becasue of which you will need to slow down are the road and the traffic. The car is limitless. The car provides absolute stability and comfort when speeding, braking, and turning. I had two co-passengers including an elderly one who suffers in other cars but had the home-sofa comfort in this one. Needless to say the height of the car can be lowered to make getting in and out easlier for those with mobility issues and for loading the boot. It has all the other usual things that you would expect at this price point, so I won't get into that long list.
If you are buing a non-hybrid, non-electric car today then you have already sold your soul to the devil. And if you have come to terms with that, this is a great great buy. My only disclaimer is that I haven't driven any other car in this specific category except the Range Rover. And this car makes the Range Rover look like garbage.
Very nice and comfortable car
Best price you can get on carwale

Extremely happy with the purchase 
It goes 0-60 in about 7-8 seconds 
Nic trims 
Nice ground clearance 
The audio quality and the infotainment system is outstanding
My dream car is BMW x5, I want to purchase this car in few months later. I have a drive this car in last week so I feel very comfortable. Then I think that I will purchase this car in the few months later.
According to a media report, BMW is planning to launch the fourth generation X5 in India around mid-2019.    
The fourth generation BMW X5 was unveiled in June 2018. It is based on BMW's Cluster Architecture (CLAR) that also underpins the 5 Series and 7 Series sedans. It measures 4,922 mm in length, 2,004 mm in width and 1,745 mm in height. The SUV offers 650 litres of luggage space, which can be increased to 1,870 litres by folding the second row of seats. 
In the international market, the new X5 comes with five powertrain options which include 3.0-litre, 6-cylinder petrol and diesel engines, a 4.4-litre, twin-turbo V8, 3.0-litre, 6-cylinder quad-turbo diesel and a 3.0-litre, 6-cylinder petrol hybrid. 
In India, the new X5 is expected to be offered with the base petrol and diesel engines. The xDrive40i variant will get a 3.0-litre, 6-cylinder turbocharged petrol unit that puts out 335 BHP @ 5,000-6000 rpm and 500 Nm of torque @ 1,600-4,500 rpm. The xDrive30d variant will be offered with a 3.0-litre, 6-cylinder turbocharged diesel engine that produces 261 BHP @ 4,000 rpm and 620 Nm @ 2,000-2,500 rpm. Both engines are likely to be mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission, while all-wheel drive will be offered as standard across the range.

I've been closely tracking the New BMW X5 [G05] 2019 as a potential upgrade for my BMW X1 E84 and the Press embargo seems to have been lifted. Although the design was revealed a few weeks ago the first round of reviews for the new BMW X5 started trickling out yesterday. 
In Summary:Big bold new design upfront. The Rear is less audacious Excellent interiors compared to the current generation cars and "Finally" BMW has stepped up their Interiors game I hope they launch both the Petrol 40i and m50d options in India. We can expect the 30d [inline 6 diesel] as has been the case in the current model First car to our shores with the new iDrive v7, which is configurable. Has apple CarPlay but No Android Auto :(

4th-gen BMW X5 spotted in India 
The fourth-generation BMW X5 has been spotted in India. The car is expected to be launched sometime in 2019.   
The new X5 is based on BMW's Cluster Architecture (CLAR). It shares its underpinnings with the 5-Series and 7-Series sedans. The car gets updated exterior styling featuring a larger twin-kidney grille finished in chrome flanked by twin-pod LED headlights. The front bumper has chrome inserts and houses a pair of fog lamps. At the rear, the new X5 gets redesigned wraparound tail lights and a new bumper with a silver scuff plate and twin chrome exhaust tips.    
On the inside, the new X5 gets dual-tone interiors and a redesigned dashboard. It has a floating touchscreen infotainment system and a digital instrument cluster.    
Seen in the spy images is the xDrive30d variant, which is expected to be offered with a 3.0-litre, 6-cylinder diesel engine that produces 261 BHP @ 4,000 rpm and 620 Nm @ 2,000-2,500 rpm. It is likely to be paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission and an all-wheel drive system.

Some better pictures from Canada, I took an extended test drive last week. It appears to carry similar interiors and looks we are getting the Off-Road package standard-  second button alongside the one for height adjustment. 
If we ignore the front grill, this stands better chances than any previous versions. Hope they keep closer to existing prices rather than launching at higher prices and then coming up with discounts.  
Nice Article, last picture is from this article.  https://jalopnik.com/the-2019-bmw-x5...now-1828985894

Well, I don’t quite agree to her observations regarding comfort at rear. Although, leg room has improved, you still sit low. You sit sort of “in” the seats and not “on” the seats. I checked the Q8 back to back and found its rear seats far better in which you sit more upright. I believe they will have better rear sitting on the X7 including optional rear Captain seats.

How was the car to drive?
How comfortable is it on the air springs?
Is it good on bad roads?
Have you driven the F15? How does it compare?  
I've driven the F15 [previous gen] extensively and loved the comfort,performance and agility. My current X1 E84 is getting too small for my growing family.  
I wonder if any of the Auto-braking safety tech will make it to the Indian version.
Analysing the spy shots on Motoroids, the Radar Scanner in the bumper leads me to believe that the version configured for India has the Driving Assistant Pro package. This suggests that Auto braking, traffic jam assistant etc. should come with the India spec.
Volvo already has (most of) this tech on their cars, I dont see why BMW wouldn't include it.

It's totally different, the same way new 7 rides better to the older one. This is due to Air Suspension on front & rear. Bad roads - Difficult to find in Canada but Yes, I did tried on the curb and it handled good. I went for a much longer ride as oppose to Audi Q8 that I checked immediately before. I must add, after the X5 drive, I tried the new Cayenne and that was on steel springs and it actually felt even better than X5. But here in India, given the massive difference between Porsche and BMW, X5 will be No-brainer, The Quality of Leather they have used on the new X5 is even superior to the one they use on current generation 7 series, hope it makes out on the M variant atleast.

Can be a worthy upgrade surely.

There will be 2 Variants at the Launch - X Line & M Sports. Surprisingly, M Sports will be available only in Petrol. At least for 2019, that's the plan. 
X Line is fairly well equipped with 20 Inches wheel and standard Air Suspension as well as Panoramic Sky lounge & Laser lights.
An invite for day after tomorrow, in Pune.  
They launched around expected prices, Sports variant is a surprise though. Normally they launch stripped versions at a later time.

It's the Velar effect. 
I would still probably pick the Velar Petrol over the X5 diesel Sport Line though.  
The petrol Msport version is not rolled out, it will be available in coming months.

Yes, they are not having any information on Petrol, which is a shame given the publicity and efforts they/ dealers are doing. If you can't deliver the products at Launch of a product that too which is essentially CKD, its nothing but ill-planning.  
As in the past, they have kept few things for subsequent refreshes. Ventilated seats is one handy feature missing here as well on the upcoming X7. Similarly, they have kept the sky-lounge only for the X-Line Diesel  &  HUD is available only on the M-Sports. Guess they have tried to balance features and prices. I won't blame BMW much on this, but they should have launched more aggressively given the facts that the last generation was always sold at 15-20 % Discounts. 
They might get some sales until GLC is launched as there are not many choices, and Air Suspension will undoubtedly improve the comfort levels.    Quote:

Well, I can understand your concerns about the Diesel but I will pick a 6 cylinder Diesel over that 4 cylinder Petrol and more importantly due to the reliability of LR products in general. Though Velar looks handsome
