It was wonderful experience buying BMW X1 at Navanit Motor's in Bangalore, Aahh How should I explain about Driving Experience it's just power beast when you foot down, it brings me a smile on my face such a smooth driving experience, driven 46k it's such a pleasure driving experience with it, comfortable and spacious car in it's segment, BMW service team is very friendly their response is very quick & aggressive, overall Its amazing car for a family.
Good decent powerful car. Bad Tyres, RFT. Done less than 25000 km till now, all on highways. Already 4 incidents in RFT Tyres. In fact in all the 4 originals one was replaced by company at about 6000 km. Makes the vehicle unreliable and unsafe. No peace of mind in long drives, always looking at the TPM. 
Maybe the car was made for in city drives only. Very disappointed after the huge amount spent
Excellent luxury SUV at this price point. Good interiors nice and comfortable seats, good shape of the car. Needs bot of improvement on interior styling rest everything is fine. You will enjoy driving this vehicle.
Good suv car for me...its mileage is low but this is best for me...price is good, rear view is very good...interior is good best seat outfits.. comfortable suv car for all segments, I loving this brand
Good in Driving on Highway.. 
one needs to hold it with proper attention while throttling full down to bottom.
average in Interior than others in segment i e Audi Q 3 or Mercedes GLA.
Nice looking and beautiful color. 
Headlamps is ok.
Front grill gives a great look.  Back is very good and sporty. Price is not in range of Indian middle class,  upper can afford 
Exterior Nice and Interior design is very elegant. 
Engine noise is almost over from inside. 
Mileage is a issue but affordable for luxury pay.

Great car and experience, a dream come true for car lover.  
Superb cart driving experience. Great for indian roads and unparalleled experience with any other car in this range. 

 BMWs after sales service is very poor though, they will go to any extent to make money from car owners.
Could be a much better car, safety and luxury is a concern of this car, over all features and look is good. Tyres give a lot of problems and get punctured in about a few hundred kms. Suggested aftermarket tyre for Indian road . Boot space is very good. Not a good performer for off-roading
Using it since 2016. The best car in segment. Would recommend it blindly as I even use Audi A6 Matrix still it's better to drive and fun! Pickup is awesome and is fun to drive! Thanks
I was a great experience with the car ......the comfortness is too good and even my driving experience was much better than those of my previous cars. We do not even feel a small shock ....it seems like car is running on ice not on roads
