Driving experience is awesome. I just purchased Honda amaze s mt petrol. Value for money and can say, highly impressed with the refine engine. I would like to recommend if you planning for family and safety car then go for it. Thanks !
Buying experience was nice the dealer was so pleasing. Above expectations  driving experience, very comfortable. Look wise best in segment. Servicing little expensive. Very large boot space. Cabin is little noisy but not irritating, steering response nice. Now comes with better stiffness in suspension which increases stability on highway. Engine could have been little peppy but decent power. Mileage very good. Feels confident while driving because of safety rating 4 star. Really wonderful and beautiful car.
Driving experience is pathetic, it vibrates and makes khatara sound , for two month old new car suspension sound like decade old, two of us had to get down on slope as car could not pick up the weight , Honda Amaze CVT is bad buy and on complaint went to deaf ears ! Purchased from Viva Honda Santacruz Mumbai ! Overall rating negative !
good value for money car from last 2 year I'm driving i think it's best one sedan in this price it's best than Swift , have good mileage safety and comfort i can say it's a best value for money.
Amazing as its name Amaze. Quite comfortable and looks like muscular car #Mustang. Engine  performance could be Improved little bit. Comfort is also very good .overall great value for money
It's all good in this car and feels really comfort drive every time and really reach feeling its a good sedan in this segments and in this price range and conclusion is it's a sedan for middle family
Buying experience: Not offered test drive.  I preference on buying this care was based on Ivtec Engine as suggested by my friend.                                                                                                                                                                          Looks & performances: Overall body built denotes poor and cost cut mode.  Upholstery is very weak and defended by show room personnel.  Engine noise observed inside. Driving Experience : Gear and Clutch operation is very tight and discomfort. Very low mileage when compare to same price other branded  vehicle; even luxury SUVs are giving better mileage (average above  17 km/l) on my own experience.
Servicing & maintenance : Very difficult to make Honda workmen to understand real problem. They are very well resistant and reluctant to realize the issues.  Very poor cleanliness after service. They have made the car in to ugly (grease and dirt inside including seat).
Very smooth automatic CVT and spacious inside , some features could have been improved looking at the price overview , but decent family car especially for people driving in city for daily use.
The buying experience was just fabulous. The manager was so polite and made us get the car in a week . The driving experience is really good especially the initial pickup. Mileage around 15 (highway +city).
An unmatched flying machine which gives the feeling of being flying in the space. No jerks, no bubbling and even no feelings of road roughness. Very comfortable driving. Only one drawback i. e. Less ground clearance.
